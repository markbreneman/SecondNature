In New York State, the species has colonized the suburban and urban areas of Westchester County, and most recently individuals have been observed in New York City, although there has yet to be any breeding populations found in the island-bound sections of New York City or Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. To facilitate human-coyote coexistence, wildlife professionals are especially interested in predicting where coyotes will establish themselves and where coyotes and humans are likely to come into contact. We are developing and testing a citizen science-based landscape model of human-coyote interaction (HCI).",
